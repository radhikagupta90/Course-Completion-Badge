# Course Completion Badge Smart Contract

This repository contains a Solidity smart contract for issuing and managing course completion badges on the Ethereum blockchain. It is designed for educational institutions and course providers to award secure, verifiable badges to students who successfully complete courses.

## Vision

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc7b4ebc-a9bb-4c16-a6d5-a239eac1446b)


Our vision is to create a decentralized platform for recognizing academic achievements, where course completion badges are securely issued, stored, and verified on the blockchain. This ensures authenticity, reduces fraud, and provides lifelong proof of accomplishments.

**Ethereum Mainnet Address:** `0xYourContractAddressHere`

*(Please replace with the actual contract address after deployment)*

## Features

- **Issue Badges**: Course providers can issue badges to students.
- **Retrieve Badges**: Students can view all their received badges.
- **Secure and Verifiable**: All badges are securely stored and verifiable on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Future Scope

- **Badge Revocation**: Implement functionality to revoke badges if issued by mistake or if course completion is invalidated.
- **Badge Transfer**: Allow students to transfer their badges between Ethereum addresses.
- **Expiration Dates**: Add support for badges with expiration dates, useful for certifications that need renewal.

## Installation & Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/course-completion-badge.git
   cd course-completion-badge
   ```

2. **Compile and deploy the contract** using Truffle:
   ```bash
   truffle compile
   truffle migrate --network mainnet
   ```

3. **Interact with the contract**:
   - Use the `issueBadge` function to issue badges.
   - Use the `getBadges` function to retrieve badges for a specific recipient.
